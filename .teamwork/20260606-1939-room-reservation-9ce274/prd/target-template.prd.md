TARGET TEMPLATE · PRD — Product Requirements Document (default)
This file is the contract. Each fillable section carries an annotation:
  <!- - origination: id=SECTION-ID; blocks=BOOL; min-confidence=N; kind=TYPE - ->
and a self-sufficient rubric. The Template Analyst derives contract.lock.md from
these (the same engine as origination-brainstorm / readiness-package / tech-assessment —
the marker keyword stays `origination:`).
The confidence line adds an Origin field (inherited | synthesized | po_authored |
cto_authored | decided) per personas/02-po.md §2/§10/§11 and templates/04-prd.md.

THE PRD IS A MERGE, NOT A CAPTURE. It stitches two FROZEN upstream artifacts —
the Readiness Package (product, authored by the PO) and the Technical Assessment
(technical, authored by the CTO) — into one document delivered to the PM. Most
sections are `inherited` (carried forward, summarized, never rewritten) or `derived`
(synthesized/reconciled FROM the inherited material). Authorship is preserved: the
PO does not rewrite the technical half; the CTO does not rewrite the product half.
`PRD = RP (PO) + Technical Assessment (CTO)`. See references/merge.md.

TWO PATHS, ONE TEMPLATE. The `meta` escalation field governs Part B:
 - ESCALATED  → the TA was produced (signed); Part B is filled from it (Origin: inherited).
 - NOT ESCALATED → no architectural impact; every Part B section is dispositioned
   `Disposition: decided` with "N/A — no architectural escalation" (an honest
   disposition that clears the gate). See references/reconciliation.md.
A VETOED TA (Infeasible as scoped) is NOT mergeable: there is no PRD until the PO
revises the RP scope and re-escalates. The orchestrator stops before drafting.

To use a different document type, copy this file, re-annotate, and pass it as TEMPLATE.
See references/contract-and-template.md (in origination-brainstorm).
Default confidence threshold (X) = 70. Raise per-section for high-stakes fields.

# PRD — [Demand name]
<!-- rev: 0 · updated: YYYY-MM-DD -->

> The PRD (Product Requirements Document) is the **merge** of the **Readiness Package**
> (product, authored by the PO) with the **Technical Assessment** (technical, authored by
> the CTO). It is the **only artifact that opens the downstream** — delivered to the **PM**.
> Each half keeps clear authorship: the PO does not write the technical part, the CTO does
> not rewrite the product. The PRD **stitches, reconciles, and exposes** to the PM what they
> need to plan — without rewriting either source. See `personas/02-po.md` §2/§10/§11 and
> `templates/04-prd.md`.
>
> **When there was no CTO escalation:** the PRD is formed from the RP alone; Part B is
> dispositioned "N/A — no architectural escalation".
>
> `PRD = RP (PO) + Technical Assessment (CTO)`

## Sign-off
<!-- origination: id=sign-off; blocks=true; min-confidence=85; kind=capture -->
> Rubric: the merge **only closes with dual sign-off**. The PO signs the product half
> (the RP is frozen — `freezeReady`); the CTO signs the technical half (the TA is signed —
> the feasibility verdict carried from the TA), or the CTO field is an **honest N/A** when
> there was no escalation. The PRD cannot freeze (`handoffReady`) without this row resolved.
> The feasibility verdict is **inherited from the TA, never re-decided here**. A vetoed TA
> never reaches this section — there is no PRD on a veto. High threshold: this is the gate.

| Role | Name | Verdict | Date |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PO** (product) | [Name] | RP Frozen (`freezeReady`) | YYYY-MM-DD |
| **CTO** (technical) | [Name] / — | Feasible / Feasible with caveats / N/A — no escalation | YYYY-MM-DD |

> the expected business outcome. The one-page view for CEO/CFO/PM. **Synthesized** from the
> inherited sections (it adds no new facts — it composes the ones already merged). A good
> summary lets a reader who reads nothing else still know why this demand, what it delivers,
> whether it is feasible, and the outcome it targets.
