TARGET TEMPLATE · Technical Assessment (default)
This file is the contract. Each fillable section carries an annotation:
  <!- - origination: SECTION-ID; blocks=BOOL; min-confidence=N; kind=TYPE - ->
and a self-sufficient rubric. The Template Analyst derives contract.lock.md from
these (the same engine as origination-brainstorm / readiness-package — the marker
keyword stays `origination:`).
The confidence line adds an Origin field (inherited | ai_drafted | cto_authored |
reused_from_KB) per personas/03-cto.md §3/§6 and templates/03-technical-assessment.md.
The TA is the CTO's output: it RESPONDS to the RP and is authored ALONE by the CTO —
it never edits the RP. To use a different document type, copy this file, re-annotate,
and pass it as TEMPLATE. See references/contract-and-template.md (in origination-brainstorm).
Default confidence threshold (X) = 70. Raise per-section for high-stakes fields.

TWO PATHS, ONE TEMPLATE. The `tech-classification` section governs which path is
required: Greenfield (the TA DEFINES the foundation — fill `tech-foundation`) or
Brownfield/Hybrid (the TA DISCOVERS the current system — fill `current-state`).
Fill the applicable path; the other is dispositioned `Disposition: decided` with
content "N/A — see Technical classification" (an honest disposition that clears the
gate). See references/classification.md.

# Technical Assessment — [Demand name]
<!-- rev: 0 · updated: YYYY-MM-DD -->

> The Technical Assessment (TA) is the **CTO's output** — and goes **beyond
> architecture**: it establishes the **technical terrain** on which engineering decides.
> Because the execution layer (human or AI agent) **has no implicit knowledge of the
> source code**, the TA makes explicit what normally goes unstated: the nature of the
> demand (new vs. existing software), the current state or the foundation to be created,
> the knowledge base, the feasibility of each NFR, the discarded alternatives,
> testability, and observability. It is written **alone** by the CTO, **in parallel** with
> the Readiness Package, and **responds** to it: the CTO **never edits the RP**. The TA
> does not redefine the product — it may **veto** the feasibility of the scope, in which
> case the PO revises the RP scope. The merge of the RP (product) with this TA (technical)
> happens in the PRD. See `personas/03-cto.md`, `personas/02-po.md` §2/§10, and
> `interactions/05-po-to-cto.md` / `interactions/06-cto-to-po.md`.

## Feasibility Verdict
<!-- origination: id=feasibility-verdict; blocks=true; min-confidence=85; kind=capture -->
> Rubric: the **CTO's first-class decision** (`personas/03-cto.md` §3 — *feasibility is
> first class*: every judgment carries `verdict` + `rationale` + **`terrain`** +
> `confidence` + `source` + `generates`). Carries rationale — never a rubber stamp — and
> the **terrain** it rests on: *"feasibility cannot be assessed on unknown terrain"*
> (`03-cto.md` §3, the CTO's golden rule). If **Infeasible as scoped**, the CTO returns
> with a veto + rationale; the PO revises the RP scope and re-escalates. The CTO does not
> redefine the product. This section resolves only at high confidence (feasibility is the
> CTO's central judgment).

## Technical classification and Knowledge Base
<!-- origination: id=tech-classification; blocks=true; min-confidence=80; kind=capture -->
> Rubric: **the decision that governs the rest of the document.** Inherits the demand
> nature from the Intake and confirms it under the technical lens. Defines which path to
> fill (greenfield vs. brownfield) and anchors the TA in the knowledge base — what exists,
> what is missing, what will be created. If the KB does not exist or is incomplete
> (brownfield), documenting the current system is a **prerequisite**: register it as a
> spike in the *Discovery Path* and produce/update the `tech-landscape`. If greenfield,
> the foundational ADRs **seed** a new `tech-landscape`.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Nature (confirmed by CTO)** | Greenfield (new) · Brownfield (existing) · Hybrid (new within existing) |

## BROWNFIELD Path — Current state / Technical landscape
<!-- origination: id=current-state; blocks=true; min-confidence=75; kind=capture -->
> Rubric: **document the system before changing it** (fill in if the demand modifies
> existing software). In brownfield, the implementation decision depends on what already
> exists — patterns, conventions, integrations, debt. This is the equivalent of BMAD's
> *document-project*. When an up-to-date `tech-landscape` exists, **reference it** and
> record here only what is specific to this demand. **If greenfield:** not applicable —
> `Disposition: decided`, content "N/A — greenfield (see Technical classification)".

### Existing patterns and conventions to respect

| Aspect | How it is today | Implication for this demand |
|---|---|---|
| **Code structure / organization** | [Where things live] | [What to follow] |
| **Data / persistence patterns** | [Model, migrations] | |
| **API / contract patterns** | [REST/events, versioning] | |
| **Authentication / authorization** | [How it is applied] | |

### Integration points touched

| Integration point | System/module | Coupling nature | Risk of changing |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Interface/service] | [Who] | [Synchronous / event / shared DB] | High / Medium / Low |

### Technical debt and regression risk

| Area | Known debt / fragility | Regression risk | Current test coverage |

## GREENFIELD Path — Technical foundation
<!-- origination: id=tech-foundation; blocks=true; min-confidence=75; kind=capture -->
> Rubric: **decide the foundation — with criteria, not by reflex** (fill in if the demand
> builds new software/module). In greenfield there is no terrain to discover: the TA
> **creates** it. Record the base choices and the *why*, so they sustain ADRs and become
> the starting point of the new `tech-landscape`. **If pure brownfield:** not applicable —
> `Disposition: decided`, content "N/A — brownfield (see Technical classification)".

### Stack selection (with criteria)

| Layer | Choice | Decision criterion | Discarded alternative |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Language / runtime** | [Choice] | [Why — team, ecosystem, performance] | [What and why not] |
